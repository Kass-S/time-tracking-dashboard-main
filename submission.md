Recreate the prototype from the figma given by Fronted Mentor.

Peer review: The code is neatly organized. The design of the cards match well with the prototype. I would suggest trying to straighten out the profile image for mobile screens and try to center your designs in the middle of the desktop screen. Still, its a great job.
